    INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANALYSIS:
    1. **CLASSIFY THE ISSUE:**
       - Is it a **Government/Forest Issue**? (Eviction notice, Tribal Belt, Forest Dept).
       - Is it a **Private Civil Dispute**? (Neighbor boundary, Family inheritance, Money, Fraud).
    
    2. **SELECT THE RIGHT LAWS:**
       - **If Private Dispute:** Prioritize "General Law" (Hindu Succession Act, Registration Act) and "Civil Remedies" (Simana Nirdharan, Partition Suit).
       - **If Government Eviction:** Prioritize "Prodyut Bora Case", "Section 165 ALRR", and "Due Process" (15-day notice).
    
    3. **BE HELPFUL:**
       - Do not just say "It is illegal." Give the user a Step-by-Step Action Plan (e.g., "File an FIR," "Apply for Mutation").
